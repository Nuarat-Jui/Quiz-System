# About Quiz System Project
This is a simple quiz system implemented in Java, where an admin can manage a collection of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and students can take a quiz based on those questions. The system uses JSON files to store user credentials, quiz questions, and answers.
- Admin: Manages the question bank by adding new questions through the system, which are then stored in a quiz.json file.
- Student: Takes a quiz consisting of 10 random questions from the quiz.json question bank and receives a score based on their answers.
